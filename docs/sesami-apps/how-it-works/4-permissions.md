# Permissions

If an app wants to read or change some data from a shop, it should have the correct access to that part. These permissions can be set during the app registration inside the Admin Portal.

Once the permissions set and the app registered, when the Shop manager wants to install the app, the list of the app permissions will be shown, and he/she have to grant permissions to the app in order to be able to install and use it.

After the app installed, if the app owner changes the permissions, the page above will open when the Shop manager wants to open the app again.

<p>
If he/she grant the access to the app, the app can work with the new permissions, but if not, the app cannot have the new permissions.
