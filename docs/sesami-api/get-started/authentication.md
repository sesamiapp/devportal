# Getting Your Personal Access Token

To use the Sesami API, you first need to have a Personal Access Token (PAT). If you don't already have one, follow these steps:

1. Login to your store. It could be a real store or just a  development store.
2. Open the setting.
3. In the `Setting`, open the `Access Token`
4. Choose a name, required permissions and expiration date.
5. Click on `Generate Personal Access Token`.
6. Now, You can see your **Client ID** and **Personal Access Token**. **Please keep them in a secure place**.


:::important

Each **PAT** is uniquely associated with a specific **shop**. This means that the key grants access only to the resources and data for that particular shop, ensuring secure and isolated access.

:::note

As of now, **Personal Access Token** are not automatically generated through the developer portal. To obtain your PAT, please contact our Support Team. They will assist you in generating and securing your PAT, ensuring you have everything you need to start integrating with our platform.
