# Getting Your API key

To use the Sesami API, you first need to have an API Key. If you don't already have one, follow these steps:

1. Login to your store. It could be a real store or just a  development store.
2. Open the setting.
3. In the `Setting`, open the `Access Token`
4. Choose a name, required permissions and expiration date.
5. Click on `Generate Personal Access Token`.
6. Now, You can see your **Client ID** and **API key**. **Please keep them in a secure place**.


> **Important:**  
> Each API key is uniquely associated with a specific shop. This means that the key grants access only to the resources and data for that particular shop, ensuring secure and isolated access.


> **Note:**  
> As of now, API keys are not automatically generated through the developer portal. To obtain your API key, please contact our Support Team. They will assist you in generating and securing your API key, ensuring you have everything you need to start integrating with our platform.
