# Storefront SDK (Beta)

You can build your own highly customized booking experience using Sesami SDK.

:::info
The Sesami SDK for JavaScript supports the latest two versions of the most popular browsers. Internet explorer and older browsers are not supported.
:::

## Enable the SDK

The Sesami SDK is currently in closed beta release. If you're interested in trying it out, you can reach out to our customer success team via our [help desk](https://help.sesami.co/).

After this feature is activated on your store, you can enable it from:

**Sesami app > Settings > Storefront settings > Use storefront SDK**


*Enabling the Sesami SDK means that you need to implement storefront integration yourself and the Sesami button will not appear on product pages automatically.*

## Quick start

Sesami will not block your other resources from being loaded and will not cause any delays or decrease in your store's performance, So you will need to initialize it when it is ready and loaded:


```markup
<script>
  window.sesamiAsyncInit = () => {
    
    sesami = new SesamiSDK({
      variantId: {{product.selected_or_first_available_variant.id}},
      shopId: {{shop.id}},
      productId: {{product.id}},
      quantity: 1,
      autoLoad: true
    })

    sesami.init();
  }
</script>

```

The code above will create a Sesami instance, You use it to render a fully customized calendar and get availabilities for each day.

## Data
Each instance of the Sesami SDK will contain a `data` object with the following structure:

```js
sesami = new SesamiSDK({/*options*/})

sesami.data
/*
{
  labels: Array<Date>,
  Rows: Array<Array<SesamiDayObject>>
}

example:

{
  labels: [Sun Dec 05 2021 00:00:00 {}, Mon Nov 29 2021 00:00:00 {}, ...],
  Rows: [
    [
      date: Sun Nov 28 2021 00:00:00 {}
      getAvailabilities: async Æ’ ()
      isCurrentMonth: false
      isCurrentWeek: false
      isPast: true
      isToday: false
    ],
    ...
  ]
}
*/

```
