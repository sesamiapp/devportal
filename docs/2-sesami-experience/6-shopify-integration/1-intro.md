# Intro

:::info You might not need this!

When you add the Sesami button to your product page using the Shopify Theme Customizer, by default, Sesami tries to find the product form and attach itself to it.<br></br>
You'll only need to read this section if you are trying to integrate with a theme that is not following Shopify standards, or if you need a custom behavior.

:::

Sesami turns normal Shopify products into services that can be booked and paid for. The booking flow can be different from buying a physical product. Therefore, You might want to customize your theme to provide a better user experience for your customers when booking with Sesami.

### Product tagging
Tagging products will allow you to apply these customizations only on products that are used as a service.<br></br>
Sesami is auto-tagging all Shopify products you add to Sesami as a service with the tag `sesami-service`.<br></br>
This way, all the changes will be applied to your future services only by adding a tag and you can also benefit from Shopify's features such as creating collections filtered by this tag.

:::note
The rest of this series assumes that the tag `sesami-service` was added to the product.<br></br>
Please read the [Creating and using tags in Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/using-tags) if you need help with creating or assigning tags to your products
