# Intro

The Sesami API empowers you to integrate our booking system into your applications, allowing for seamless management of appointments and scheduling. Designed for flexibility and ease of use, our API helps you automate booking processes, manage services data, and enhance user experiences.

Our platform provides support for both [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) and [**REST**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs. You can utilize either GraphQL for flexible and efficient data queries or REST for a straightforward approach.

You can find Sesami APIs here:
- [GraphQL](https://api.sesami.co/graphql)
- [REST](https://api.sesami.co/swagger)

Now, Let's dive in for building and scaling your booking capabilities.
