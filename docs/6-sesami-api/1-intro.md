# Intro

The Sesami API empowers you to integrate our booking system into your applications, allowing for seamless management of appointments and scheduling. Designed for flexibility and ease of use, our API helps you automate booking processes, manage services data, and enhance user experiences.

Our platform provides support for both [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) and [**REST**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs. You can utilize either GraphQL for flexible and efficient data queries or REST for a straightforward approach.

You can find Sesami APIs here:
- [GraphQL](https://api.sesami.co/graphql)
- [REST](https://api.sesami.co/swagger)

## Sesami (Admin) Shop ID
When using the Sesami API, all requests require a **Sesami (Admin) Shop ID**. This is an `ObjectID (string)` and is **different from the Shopify Shop ID**. You can find the Sesami Shop ID (Admin ID) in the **Shop Select Menu** of the **Sesami Admin Portal**.
